<h3>CS403 Semester Project</h3>

This project is a simulation of a turn-based, 4-player game.  Players can be assigned various strategies which will affect game move decisions.

Pick a unique game that is complicated enough to have a variety of strategy options, but you will have the liberty to simplify wherever possible.  Highly visual board games tend to be easier to implement than poker-like card games, although you are free to select a card game as well.  

Within this repo, be sure to notice the Milestones, Issues, and Wiki -- this will guide your development process!

Game selections are first-come, first-serve.  <b>Post your choice to the Wiki's "Project List"</b>, once you've made sure that no other CS403 student has already taken exactly the same game (it's certainly possible to spin one that's already taken).
