/*
•SHOW PLAYING AREA - displays everything necessary to observe the progress of the game
•SHOW PLAYER ORDER - shows player names in the order that they will play
•ADVANCE ORDER - moves the player who is currently "up" to the end of the playing order, and advances the "next" player to be "up"
•INITIALIZE GAME - performs all actions necessary to prepare the game for the first move (deal cards, place tokens in initial spots, etc.); can also be used to reset the game simulation
•CHECK FOR WINNER - determine whether any player has won the game, and if so, identity that player
•DO MOVE - the player who is currently "up" in the player order performs all move actions, and the player order advances
•DO TURN - performs DO MOVE four times, as well as CHECK FOR WINNER at appropriate times
•DO GAME - performs DO TURN until the game is won
